# Oferhlýp

## Overview
**Oferhlýp** is a free libre open source abstract strategy game played between two players on 7x7 grid. On the surface, gameplay is similar to checkers (draughts). However, there are several differences:
- Tokens may move in any direction rather than just forwards diagonally.
- A player’s own pieces may be jumped to create a more dynamic game.
- Tokens must be jumped twice before they are removed from the board.
- Each player has a "king" token that must be captured to end the  game.

## History
The first iteration of **Oferhlýp** was rooted in the basic fundamentals of another game I designed (_Claim the Crown_). The two hit-point system and jumps were present as was the original hex board, albeit in a slightly different layout. While version 1 was fun to play and had good early and middle play development, the endgame stalled and produced a lot of stalemate situations. Beginning with the version 2 fork, the board has been revised to a standard grid (_a la_ certain Hnefetafl variants) and kings have been introduced.

## Project goals
My goal with **Oferhlýp** is to build an engaging abstract strategy experience that is simple to learn while offering a level of complexity in mastering it. I opted to do this under an open source license because I am inspired by Linux and similar software and would like the game to be free (as in freedom as well as in beer) to all. I chose CC BY-SA because it's the most comparable to the the GPL.
