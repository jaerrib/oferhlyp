# Overview

> Version 2.2.1

**Oferhlýp** is a free libre open source abstract strategy game played between two players on a 7x7 grid. On the surface, gameplay is similar to checkers (draughts). However, there are several differences:

- Tokens may move in any direction rather than just forwards diagonally.
- A player’s own pieces may be jumped to create a more dynamic game.
- Tokens must be jumped twice before they are removed from the board
- Each player has a king token that must be captured to end the game.

## Objective

Players try to eliminate their opponent’s king via jumping attacks while protecting their own king.

## Components

- Game board
- 14 two-sided light tokens (1 king and 13 standard "men")
- 14 two-sided dark tokens (1 king and 13 standard "men")

*Note: kings are denoted by a different symbol design in comparison to the standard tokens.*

### Example tokens

|---|---|
|![Da   rk standard (full-strength)](../images/token-dark-full.svg) Dark (full)|![Dark king (full-strength)](../images/token-dark-king-full.svg) Dark king (full)|
| ![Light standard (half-strength)](../images/token-light-half.svg) Light (half)|![Light king (half-strength)](../images/token-light-king-half.svg) Light king (half)|


## Setup & starting the game

Players place their tokens on the squares comprising the two rows closest to them with the king occupying the middle square of the edge row. Placement is closer to chess rather than checkers as all squares are utilized regardless of color.

All tokens start at *full-strength* status with the double rune symbol side up.

Players choose which color (light or dark) to use with the dark color taking the first turn. Players then alternate taking turns.

## Additional notes

An alternative to using the printed tokens is to substitute with coins. For example, one player could use pennies for the standard tokens and a nickel for the king with the other player using dimes with a quarter for the king.
