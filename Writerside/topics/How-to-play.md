# How to play

On a player’s turn, the player may *move* or *attack* with one token.

## Moving

Tokens may move one square in any direction onto an open square.

A token belonging to the player may be jumped in a legal move called a *friendly jump*. Making more than one friendly jump per turn is not permitted.

A player may not follow a move or friendly jump by an attack. A player may not follow an attack and with a move or friendly jump.

## Attacking

Players may *attack* an opponent’s token by jumping directly over it to an open square. Attacks are not compulsory.

Players may perform a *chain attack* by jumping more than one of their opponent’s tokens in a sequence (similar to checkers) following the normal attack rule.

After being attacked, tokens at *full-strength* status are flipped over to the single rune side to signify that they are now at *half-strength*.

Tokens at *half-strength* status are removed from the board after being attacked a second time and are out of play.

Tokens may not be attacked more than once per turn, even as part of a chain attack. Players also cannot simply jump over a token then jump back over the same token.

## Winning the game

Players continue to alternate turns until one of the kings has been eliminated.

### Stalemates

A *stalemate* occurs if the two kings are the last pieces on the board as neither player could move without placing their own king into a position which would be vulnerable to an *attack*.

### Illegal board positions

Perpetual repetition is illegal. If a board position is repeated three times, the player in control of the situation must find another move.
