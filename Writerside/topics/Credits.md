**Oferhlýp** was created by John Beers. It was conceived in 2013 while working on another game, **Claim the Crown** , which incorporated the concept of tokens with two hit points, but featured various types of Middle Ages themed units, like spearmen and archers, and replaced jump attacks with dice rolling combat. **Oferhlýp** is a purer abstract interpretation of that game with a focus on strategy over luck.

Version 1.0 of **Oferhlýp** was released in 2019, and the game has been continuously iterated upon since then.

> The word *oferhlýp* is an Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word that means "a leap across or over, a bound".
